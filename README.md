This plugin depends on the vim-easymotion plugin, version 2.0

https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion

vim-easyoperator-line provides a much simpler way to use some operator for
line in Vim.

**Select, yank, paste, delete, or other operation of lines.**

The idea of this plugin is based on supasorn's work on vim-easymotion

Note: to promote good Vim habits, you should learn standard movement
commands like `}}, vi(, va(, %, ][, ]], [(, etc.` before resorting to
this function.

See :h easyoperator_line.txt for more detail
